On the capital front, OpenAI's spending reduction from $1.4 trillion to $600 billion indicates tempering expectations around AI infrastructure investment, while Goldman Sachs reports AI contributed 'basically zero' to U.S. economic growth last year. These signals suggest the industry is recalibrating after initial euphoria.\n\nGeopolitical competition remains acute. DeepSeek trained its latest model on Nvidia's Blackwell chips despite U.S. export restrictions, underscoring enforcement challenges. The U.S. government countered by launching the Tech Corps to advance AI globally. Meanwhile, technical advancement continues: Anthropic demonstrated proof of distillation at scale, with Chinese competitors achieving similar results, while Wolfram and others expand AI foundation layers.\n\nConcerns about AI's negative externalities are mounting. Research documents near-verbatim copyright infringement in generated content. Safety features like Firefox's AI Kill Switch address user autonomy. Open-source communities report harm from AI training practices. IBM's stock fell amid concerns AI could disrupt legacy systems.
