Defense Secretary Hegseth has given the company until Friday to reconsider restrictions on military applications, with the Pentagon threatening to declare Anthropic a pariah if it refuses. Reuters reports Anthropic maintains its position against easing military usage restrictions, escalating the standoff. This conflict reflects broader tensions between government defense interests and AI safety principles.\n\nElsewhere in the industry, OpenAI significantly reduced capital spending projections from $1.4 trillion to $600 billion, signaling recalibrated infrastructure expectations. Meanwhile, technical development continues: Cloudflare completed a Next.js rebuild using AI assistance, and researchers at Inception Labs introduced Mercury 2, a diffusion-powered reasoning LLM. Hugging Face expanded its ecosystem through Skills platform, and optimization work by Claude Code demonstrated substantial context compression gains.\n\nUser-facing AI integration remains contested. Firefox 148 launched an AI kill switch feature, giving users direct control over AI functionality. Separately, spam from AI-generated social media replies has become widespread, highlighting deployment externalities.
