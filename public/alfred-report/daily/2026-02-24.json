      "summary": "The AI sector shows mixed momentum with infrastructure consolidation alongside skepticism about economic impact. Browser vendors like Firefox are responding to user concerns with explicit AI controls, while development tools increasingly integrate AI assistance—evident in Ladybird's Rust adoption and FreeBSD driver generation. Platforms are positioning for ecosystem centralization: Wolfram Research offers foundational LLM infrastructure while model distillation at scale by MiniMax, DeepSeek, and Moonshot suggests competitive efficiency strategies.\n\nEconomic returns remain questionable. Goldman Sachs reported AI contributed essentially zero growth to U.S. GDP last year, contradicting deployment enthusiasm. IBM's stock decline following Anthropic's announcement about COBOL suggests investor concern over legacy system disruption.\n\nPolicy and safety concerns dominate discourse. Documentation of near-verbatim novel generation raises copyright issues; AI-generated social media replies fuel moderation challenges; open-source communities report sustainability pressures. Institutional responses vary: the Vatican discourages AI for homily writing while the U.S. government launched Peace Corps-backed Tech Corps for global AI implementation in agriculture, education, and health sectors.\n\nAnthropologic's educational initiatives and Anthropic's fluency index suggest the industry recognizes workforce literacy as a priority. Overall, the narrative reflects simultaneous technological advancement, widespread skepticism about near-term value delivery, and increasing institutional involvement in governance and deployment.",
