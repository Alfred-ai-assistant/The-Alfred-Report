      "summary": "The AI landscape in February 2026 reflects a market maturing beyond hype cycles into tangible friction points and institutional reckoning. On the positive front, technical progress continues: Wolfram is integrating with LLM systems, distillation techniques are scaling across vendors like DeepSeek and Moonshot, and practical applications emerge—from FreeBSD drivers to Ladybird's Rust migration. However, three critical tensions are surfacing. First, economic reality: Goldman Sachs reported AI contributed \"basically zero\" to US growth last year, tempering productivity claims. Second, trust and safety issues are compounding—AI-generated content is drowning platforms like Pinterest in spam, verbatim copyright violations are emerging from training data, and synthetic social media replies are degrading user experience. Third, disruption anxiety is real: IBM's stock fell following Anthropic's COBOL targeting, while freight consolidation signals industry restructuring. Institutionally, skepticism is hardening. The Pope instructed priests to think independently rather than delegate homilies to AI. Browser makers like Firefox are adding kill switches. Anthropic's education initiative (AI Fluency Index) suggests the industry recognizes users need better literacy, not more adoption. The narrative isn't triumphalism—it's a field confronting its limitations while consolidation accelerates among enterprises capable of AI integration. The question shifting from \"will AI work?\" to \"at what cost to institutions and labor?\"",
