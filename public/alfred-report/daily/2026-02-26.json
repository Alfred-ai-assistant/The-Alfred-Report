      "summary": "The AI landscape shows divergent trajectories across safety, competition, and deployment. Anthropic's reported shift away from core safety promises contradicts its founding positioning, while Pentagon scrutiny signals emerging government oversight. OpenAI faces competitive pressure with reported feature gaps in GPT-5.2, even as questions about its competitive strategy persist. Google continues advancing image generation with Nano Banana 2, while Claude maintains developer preference despite statistical quirks in its outputs. Hardware dominance remains clear: Nvidia posted record $215 billion revenue and beat forecasts, though inference competition intensifies. API security practices are evolving with Gemini's deployment raising credential management questions. Enterprise adoption accelerates with Burger King implementing AI for service monitoring and TeamOut targeting corporate events. Technical analysis reveals ongoing model limitations—from 3D generation quality issues to name generation bias—suggesting maturing but imperfect capabilities. The sector shows simultaneous consolidation around capable models, regulatory emergence, and mainstream deployment across retail and enterprise functions.",
