      "summary": "The AI sector shows mixed signals on maturation and impact. Goldman Sachs reports AI contributed essentially zero to US economic growth last year, challenging narratives of transformative productivity gains. Yet infrastructure continues advancing: Firefox 148 introduces an AI kill switch, Ladybird adopts Rust with AI assistance, and multiple LLM providers achieve model distillation at scale, suggesting efficiency improvements in deployment.\n\nEnterprise adoption appears selective. Anthropic's COBOL capability threatens legacy system maintenance roles, while C.H. Robinson's CEO expects AI-driven consolidation in freight brokerage. Wolfram is positioning its technology as a foundation layer for LLM systems, indicating market stratification around specialized tools.\n\nQuality and governance concerns mount. Training data reproduction of copyrighted novels raises IP issues. Pinterest suffers from AI-generated content spam overwhelming moderation. The Pope directs priests to use reasoning rather than AI for homilies. Videos criticize AI's effect on open-source sustainability. Anthropic announced an education fluency index, addressing workforce readiness gaps.\n\nThese stories reflect an industry transitioning from hype to operational reality—where AI tooling integrates into workflows, but economic impact remains uncertain, governance frameworks lag behind deployment, and content quality challenges persist at scale.",
