      "summary": "The AI industry faces intensifying tensions between safety commitments and government pressure. Anthropic has dropped its flagship safety pledge and maintains resistance to military usage restrictions despite Pentagon threats of isolation, while US Military leaders directly argue for removing Claude safeguards. This reflects broader friction between AI safety practices and institutional demands.\n\nMeanwhile, competitive pressures shape infrastructure decisions. OpenAI revised capital spending expectations downward from $1.4T to $600B, indicating recalibrated investment strategies. Geopolitically, DeepSeek's use of Nvidia's Blackwell chip despite US export controls demonstrates the limited effectiveness of semiconductor restrictions in AI competition between nations.\n\nEnterprise adoption continues accelerating. Cloudflare rebuilt Next.js with AI in one week, while Hugging Face expanded its platform with Skills and Claude Code Remote Control broadens enterprise automation. Firefox 148's AI Kill Switch feature reflects growing user demand for explicit control over AI integration.\n\nBroader concerns persist. AI-generated replies proliferate across platforms, raising authenticity questions. The Federal Reserve acknowledged AI's labor market disruption potential. A reported identity surveillance system involving OpenAI, the US government, and Persona raises oversight questions about AI infrastructure deployment.",
